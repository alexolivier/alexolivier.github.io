          <section class="content"><p>In 5 days, I am moving to New York! <a href="http://www.qubitproducts.com/">Qubit</a>, the startup I work for, currently has a <a href="http://www.qubitproducts.com/contact">sales office in Manhattan</a>, and I have being sent over there to setup the client engineering&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>It will only be for a few months, but quite a scary prospect when I come to think of it. I will be responsible for doing technical pre-sales work, dealing our <span class="caps">US</span> clients, interviewing, hiring a training of engineers, aswell as keeping up with some of my current UK based&nbsp;clients.</p>
<p>As for living, I’ve <a href="http://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1673289">found a really nice</a> one bed apartment in Chelsea that is only 4 blocks from our office. This has been my first time using <a href="http://airbnb.co.uk/">AirBnB</a> and so far the process has been <span class="caps">OK</span> - the first place I tried fell through, but hopefully this will all be sorted&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>As our <span class="caps">CTO</span> pointed out to me, this thing only really happens in startups…and I’ve only been at Qubit since&nbsp;August!</p>
<p>Fun&nbsp;times!</p>
