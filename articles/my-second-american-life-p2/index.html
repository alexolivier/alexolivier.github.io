          <section class="content"><p>After being here for nearly 2 weeks now, a few more things have distracted me from the day to&nbsp;day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everyone walks around on their phones via a headset (usually the Apple earphones + inline microphone). This makes for a rather amusing sight as a mass of people walk around all seemingly talking to&nbsp;themselves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I watched the Superbowl - still don’t understand the sport, but even I can tell that was a poor game. Also the commericals weren’t even that&nbsp;great.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New Yorkers don’t like tourists or crowds. The shouting whilst fighting my way up Superbowl Boulevard proved that&nbsp;stereotype.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wash and fold laundry service is awesome - and&nbsp;cheap!</p>
</li>
<li><p>New York deli’s have pretty much anything you could ever want for&nbsp;lunch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>America is big. I’ve been booking flights to Houston today for a short weekend down there, and am always astounded that Texas is 4 hours or so away from&nbsp;<span class="caps">NYC</span>!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flights can be really expensive or really cheap, but not really in the middle. Direct flights to Houston from <span class="caps">NYC</span> are heading towards a grand, but both ways I have one short stop over and my return ticket was just over $300 - not bad. I am also looking at spending a weekend in Los Angeles, and if I book it now, I can get a return for about the&nbsp;same.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I seem to be loosing my coffee habbit - not sure if that is due to the weak coffee here or just gotten over&nbsp;it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is still&nbsp;cold.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, after a very correct point from a friend on Facebook, this series should really be called ‘My Second American Life’ due to having lived in Texas for 5 years whilst growing up, so the title has been&nbsp;updated.</p>
