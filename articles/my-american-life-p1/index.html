          <section class="content"><p>So having been here in New York for nearly a week now, there are a few things that I have&nbsp;noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s cold! It has been averaging around -5C here this week, and went down to -14C at its low point. My office is only 7 blocks away, but after about 3 I can’t feel my face, and this is with my ski jacket&nbsp;on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I already knew this one, <span class="caps">TV</span> here is awful, and I’m not just talking about the adverts. The production value of headline shows like Good Morning America is terrible. There is too much jumping around, and the audio levels are all over the&nbsp;place.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a startup at least, there is too much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valleyspeak" title="Valleyspeak">valleyspeak</a>. It is like totally like cold out. And I think every sentence ends in a&nbsp;question?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I caught the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arhBRouSmWs">State of the Union</a> where Obama did his stuff. As always I find American politics way too panderous and they really need quit the whole standing ovation thing every minute…also ‘God Bless&nbsp;America’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Omce the State of the Union had finished, the first thing one of the <span class="caps">NBC</span> (not even Fox!) commentators said ‘America needs to remember that Obama is only one letter away from one of the previous most wanted men in the&nbsp;world’…really?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Immigration at airports is not as stupid as it was - only one weird&nbsp;question.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Nerds">King of the Nerds</a> is a program about some obviously clever people in a Big Brother-esque house who are deeply interested in their own particular areas, except sadly I know it is only getting viewers who laugh at these&nbsp;people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apparently there is <a href="http://www.superbowl.com/" title="Superbowl">some football game</a> on this&nbsp;weekend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Central Park in the snow is really nice to walk&nbsp;around.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Supermarkets are really expensive. Fast food is dirt&nbsp;cheap.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Every girl between about 16 and 25 wears boots, black leggings, body warmer, ear muffs and has a&nbsp;Starbucks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The internet really does make the world&nbsp;smaller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I still love Mountain&nbsp;Dew.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sure there are plenty more things that I can’t think of at the moment, but this is going to be a series I think. Also, I am putting <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+AlexOlivierUK/albums/5973264711378523937">photos up on my Google+</a>.</p>
