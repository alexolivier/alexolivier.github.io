After being here for nearly 2 weeks now, a few more things have distracted me from the day to day.

- Everyone walks around on their phones via a headset (usually the Apple earphones + inline microphone). This makes for a rather amusing sight as a mass of people walk around all seemingly talking to themselves.

- I watched the Superbowl - still don't understand the sport, but even I can tell that was a poor game. Also the commericals weren't even that great.

- New Yorkers don't like tourists or crowds. The shouting whilst fighting my way up Superbowl Boulevard proved that stereotype.

- Wash and fold laundry service is awesome - and cheap!

- New York deli's have pretty much anything you could ever want for lunch.

- America is big. I've been booking flights to Houston today for a short weekend down there, and am always astounded that Texas is 4 hours or so away from NYC!

- Flights can be really expensive or really cheap, but not really in the middle. Direct flights to Houston from NYC are heading towards a grand, but both ways I have one short stop over and my return ticket was just over $300 - not bad. I am also looking at spending a weekend in Los Angeles, and if I book it now, I can get a return for about the same.

- I seem to be loosing my coffee habbit - not sure if that is due to the weak coffee here or just gotten over it.

- It is still cold.

Also, after a very correct point from a friend on Facebook, this series should really be called 'My Second American Life' due to having lived in Texas for 5 years whilst growing up, so the title has been updated.
