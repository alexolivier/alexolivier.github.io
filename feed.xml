      <description>&lt;p&gt;After being here for nearly 2 weeks now, a few more things have distracted me from the day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone walks around on their phones via a headset (usually the Apple earphones + inline microphone). This makes for a rather amusing sight as a mass of people walk around all seemingly talking to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watched the Superbowl - still don’t understand the sport, but even I can tell that was a poor game. Also the commericals weren’t even that great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers don’t like tourists or crowds. The shouting whilst fighting my way up Superbowl Boulevard proved that stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash and fold laundry service is awesome - and cheap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York deli’s have pretty much anything you could ever want for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;America is big. I’ve been booking flights to Houston today for a short weekend down there, and am always astounded that Texas is 4 hours or so away from NYC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flights can be really expensive or really cheap, but not really in the middle. Direct flights to Houston from NYC are heading towards a grand, but both ways I have one short stop over and my return ticket was just over $300 - not bad. I am also looking at spending a weekend in Los Angeles, and if I book it now, I can get a return for about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I seem to be loosing my coffee habbit - not sure if that is due to the weak coffee here or just gotten over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is still cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, after a very correct point from a friend on Facebook, this series should really be called ‘My Second American Life’ due to having lived in Texas for 5 years whilst growing up, so the title has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Second American Life - Part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So having been here in New York for nearly a week now, there are a few things that I have noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s cold! It has been averaging around -5C here this week, and went down to -14C at its low point. My office is only 7 blocks away, but after about 3 I can’t feel my face, and this is with my ski jacket on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I already knew this one, TV here is awful, and I’m not just talking about the adverts. The production value of headline shows like Good Morning America is terrible. There is too much jumping around, and the audio levels are all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a startup at least, there is too much &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valleyspeak&quot; title=&quot;Valleyspeak&quot;&gt;valleyspeak&lt;/a&gt;. It is like totally like cold out. And I think every sentence ends in a question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I caught the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arhBRouSmWs&quot;&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; where Obama did his stuff. As always I find American politics way too panderous and they really need quit the whole standing ovation thing every minute…also ‘God Bless America’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omce the State of the Union had finished, the first thing one of the NBC (not even Fox!) commentators said ‘America needs to remember that Obama is only one letter away from one of the previous most wanted men in the world’…really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration at airports is not as stupid as it was - only one weird question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Nerds&quot;&gt;King of the Nerds&lt;/a&gt; is a program about some obviously clever people in a Big Brother-esque house who are deeply interested in their own particular areas, except sadly I know it is only getting viewers who laugh at these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superbowl.com/&quot; title=&quot;Superbowl&quot;&gt;some football game&lt;/a&gt; on this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Park in the snow is really nice to walk around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets are really expensive. Fast food is dirt cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every girl between about 16 and 25 wears boots, black leggings, body warmer, ear muffs and has a Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet really does make the world smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still love Mountain Dew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are plenty more things that I can’t think of at the moment, but this is going to be a series I think. Also, I am putting &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/photos/+AlexOlivierUK/albums/5973264711378523937&quot;&gt;photos up on my Google+&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 5 days, I am moving to New York! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qubitproducts.com/&quot;&gt;Qubit&lt;/a&gt;, the startup I work for, currently has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qubitproducts.com/contact&quot;&gt;sales office in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, and I have being sent over there to setup the client engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will only be for a few months, but quite a scary prospect when I come to think of it. I will be responsible for doing technical pre-sales work, dealing our US clients, interviewing, hiring a training of engineers, aswell as keeping up with some of my current UK based clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for living, I’ve found a really nice one bed apartment near Union Square that is only 7 blocks from our office. This has been my first time using &lt;a href=&quot;http://airbnb.co.uk/&quot;&gt;AirBnB&lt;/a&gt; and so far the process has been OK - the first place I tried fell through, but hopefully this will all be sorted now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our CTO pointed out to me, this thing only really happens in startups…and I’ve only been at Qubit since August!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun times!&lt;/p&gt;
